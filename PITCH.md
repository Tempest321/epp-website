**The problem:**
- Construction estimates are typically 9-24% lower than actual costs
- Only 25% of projects finish within 10% of their original deadline
- 32% of cost overruns come directly from estimating errors
- Industry margins are 5-7%, so overruns eat your entire profit

## What You're Losing

For a company with around $30M gross revenue, we estimate you lose somewhere between **$1.95M - $4.05M annually** on overrun projects.

**Where that money goes:**

| Category | Estimated Loss | What happens |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Overtime & emergency labor | $900k - $1.8M | Missed deadlines force expensive last-minute crews |
| Idle crew time | $360k - $720k | Bad scheduling leaves teams waiting between tasks |
| Delay penalties | $150k - $450k | Liquidated damages at $300-1000/day add up fast |
| Rework | $300k - $600k | Problems caught late cost more to fix |
| Emergency equipment & rush orders | $240k - $480k | Poor forecasting means paying premium prices |

These losses often exceed your entire net profit margin.

| Investment Level | What You Get | Expected Accuracy | Annual Savings | % of Revenue |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Starter** | Base model trained on your data | 80% | $390k - $810k | ~1-3% |
| **Standard** | + Scope Tracker for PM reports | 85-90% | $780k - $1.6M | ~3-5% |

## Why It Works

- Human estimators are ±10-15% accurate at best
- ML trained on company data gets to 5% or better (2-5x improvement)
- Your data teaches the model your cost patterns, your delays, your terminology — while additional industry data fills in gaps
